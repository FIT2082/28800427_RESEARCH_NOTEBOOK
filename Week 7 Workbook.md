Project Workbook â€“ Week 7
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  I was unable to attend the meeting this week due to illness. Grace has caught me up.
  
Progress:
---------
- Grace has finished the Python program to convert to GenTra so that we can run input into the CSP-Singer program, though it still needs some testing.
- We are now ready to move to the analysis phase, pending some preliminary tests and tweaks.
- We will look at automating some of the processes involved with our workflow, once we have judged the timeframe we're looking at.
