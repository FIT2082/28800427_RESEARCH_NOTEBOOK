Project Workbook â€“ Week 12
=========================

Meeting:
--------
- Our meeting this week addressed some final changes for the poster, and our direction after that assessment was complete. 
  
Progress:
---------
- Finished the poster, and presented it
- The presentation went well, and generally the demo seemed to be well received and people seemed interested in the project

Problems:
---------
- Sadly the demo could only be done via the Grace's laptop, as the room was not set up well for us to have a dedicated screen to use at the time of our presentation
- We ended up having a rush to the finish with the poster design, and the diagram in particular didn't quite turn out how it was planned
- As expected, it is now fairly obvious that our timeline didn't adequately capture the amount of delay we would encounter. As such, we are now at a point where we will almost certainly not find the time to communicate in our final report the full extend of the usefulness (or uselessness) of the sonification of a CSP's execution.

To Do:
------
- Make sure databases exist for both Standard and Gecode compilation of the problem instances, so that we can perform comparisons if necessary
- Upload the poster to GIT
- Grace will generate a large number of MIDI files (as she has automated the process of processing the dbs using CSP-Singer
- Start analysing the MIDI files and try to find anomalies should they exist - relating them back to the search tree and ultimately trying to figure out changes in behaviour of the CSP
