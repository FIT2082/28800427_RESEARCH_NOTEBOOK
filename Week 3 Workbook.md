Project Workbook – Week 3
=========================

Meeting:
--------

   This week neither Grace nor I were able to attend a meeting with Guido and Kevin, despite an attempt at rescheduling. Grace and I have also been busy and thus haven't found the time to catch up amongst ourselves. We have therefore made minimal progress on the project this week.

Progress:
---------

   From the previous week's To Do:
   
1. ~Analyse the research paper and take some notes~
2. ~Take some lessons on Coursera for MiniZinc practice~ **(have not yet completed as much as I intend to, though)**
3. Give the CSP-singer source code a look and investigate the MIDI disassembly format – which is its output **(have read up on MIDI only)**
4. ~Start writing the project specification to get some feedback from Guido and Kevin before it&#39;s due next week~ **(some attempt has been made, though we are yet to send anything to our supervisors)**

The lack of progress this week is mostly due to the amount of other committments I've had to get sorted. I exect next week to be considerably more productive.

To Do:
------
   My aims between now and our next meeting are:

1. Finish familiarising myself with MiniZinc
2. Read over the CSP-Singer source (even if it is in French) and take some notes to try to understand the broad strokes
3. Continue with the project spec and have something to run by Guido and Kevin at the meeting to finalise between then and Friday night
