Project Workbook â€“ Week 8
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  Grace and I met with Guido and Kevin this Tuesday to discuss our progress. We received some feedback on our project specifications, and Grace worked out some kinks in the converter.
  
Progress:
---------
- A bit more modification of the GenTra converter may now be necessary before we can move to actually analysis, however it is coming along by Grace's talents.
- I have been setting up my device to generate the necessary SQLite databases for our analysis.

To Do:
------
- While Grace is finishing off the converter, I will devise problem categories so that we can group our output databases for analysis
- Once done, I will begin generating the databases and will endeavour to upload them within this repo in batches, as they are ready
