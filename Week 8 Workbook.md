Project Workbook â€“ Week 8
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  - Grace and I met with Guido and Kevin this Tuesday to discuss our progress. 
  - We received some feedback on our project specifications, and Grace worked out some kinks in the converter.
  
Progress:
---------
- A bit more modification of the GenTra converter may now be necessary before we can move to actually analysis, however it is coming along by Grace's talents.
- I have been setting up my device to generate the necessary SQLite databases for our analysis.

To Do:
------
- I will start generating the databases which can then be fed into Grace's converter. From what I have seen, it's possible that I might be able to do some automation here. Though I cannot yet judge how easy that will be.
