Project Workbook â€“ Week 6
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  - There was no meeting with our supervisors this week since they were away.
  - We did have a scheduled meeting with Julian to check in, however I was also unable to attend this. Grace has caught me up with what she is doing.
  - I have contacted Julian to let him know that I don't currently have any concerns.
  
Progress:
---------
  - Grace has been working on Python code to convert SQLite to GenTra.
  - I have decided to work on devising problem categories for all of the problems in the MiniZinc challenge benchmark. These will be the problems that we will be running the solver on while we record its behaviour. Those problems can be found [here](https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks "MiniZinc Benchmarks").
  - Ultimately I hope that we will be able to use this to split the problems up and more easily make inferences about how meaningful sonification is during our final report. 

To Do:
------
  - Devise some problem categories. I am planning to consult with a couple of my tutors who I know to be interested in problem classes and see if they have any advice.
