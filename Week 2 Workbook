Project Workbook – Week 2
=========================

Project Assignment:
-------------------

   I have been assigned to the Sonification research project. This was my first preference – largely because I thought that the result would probably be a meaningless mess. I&#39;m excited at the prospect of undergoing research that might be confusing and reporting on my success or failure!

Meeting:
--------

   This week a meeting was held with Kevin and Guido on the Wednesday to establish the basic information required for us to begin conducting research and to grasp the project&#39;s objectives. We were provided with the original research paper and were instructed to familiarise ourselves with MiniZinc.

Progress:
---------

   I have so far this week learned what my objectives are and gained a better understanding of the nature and goals of the research.

In broad strokes, our research will seek to aid in the analysis of problem solving algorithms.

Given a problem, its potential solutions can be enumerated and an algorithm will seek to find the optimal solution to the given problem. This algorithm will detect feasible solutions and one best solution. In doing so, a tree structure can be created to record the decisions made by the algorithm in eliminating solutions and evaluating optimality.

Since the sets of solutions are incredibly large for NP-hard/complete problems such as university timetabling, generating feasible solutions can be very costly. A better understanding of the algorithms tasked with doing so may allow for the time taken to be cut down if early termination indicators can be recognised. Additionally, it may be possible to more easily compare the efficiency of different solution-generating algorithms.

To try to gain a better understanding of how these algorithms operate is our objective. Namely, to enable us to _listen_ to them. Ideally to create some coherent musical structure corresponding to the behaviour of the algorithm and then to use that to recognise patterns.

There are three components to consider:

- The MiniZinc program which executes one of two solution-generation algorithms on one of a large number of problems. From here the tree of decisions is output.
- The program which auralises the output model of behaviour.
- A middle-man program which takes the output tree and transforms that data into a usable input to the aralisation program. **This is the current missing link.**

The original research on constraint-solver aurilisation was conducted by Arnaud Lallouet and Jer&#39;emie Vautard and was designed to analyse an n-queens problem solver. Their paper can be found [here](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/auralization-of-a-constraint-solver-the-music-of-n-queens.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.2006.117;format=pdf "CSP-Singer Paper"). Their program was dubbed the &quot;CSP-singer&quot;.

And yes, it is written in French.

To Do:
------
   My aims between now and our next meeting are:

1. Analyse the research paper and take some notes
2. Take some lessons on Coursera for MiniZinc practice
3. Give the CSP-singer source code a look and investigate the MIDI disassembly format – which is its output
4. Start writing the project specification to get some feedback from Guido and Kevin before it&#39;s due next week
