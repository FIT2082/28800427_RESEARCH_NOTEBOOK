Still really busy, so haven't had a chance to fill in the last two weeks properly.

The next week will be preparation for the poster session. 
I have been writing python scripts to automate the database generation procedure and Grace and I will be generating MIDI files on Sunday. 

Will perform a number of uploads when I get the chance.
