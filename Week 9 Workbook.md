Project Workbook â€“ Week 9
=========================

Meeting:
--------
- Grace and I met with Guido and Kevin this Tuesday once again. 
- Kevin assisted me in setting up the CP Profiler tool for windows, which will allow me to analyse the behaviour trees output by the minizinc solver. 
- Kevin also confirmed that the Profiler has been updated to allow us to generate a pixel tree (a simplification of the behaviour tree) which we can use to visualise. 
- The precision of the pixel tree can be tweaked with a simple parameter.
- Guido advised that we could select benchmark tests for which the generated behaviour trees would be sufficiently small that they would take only seconds to complete - for simplicity during analysis.
  
Progress:
---------
- Grace is still making some changes to the converter program
- I have devised several lists of potential categories for databases that we could use to test.
- I should now be set up to begin generating databases, though I have yet to do this.

To Do:
------
- Now that I know we are trying to source databases that will have a smaller amount of information, and thus take less time to analysis - I will revisit my database (problem) categories and see if they are still suitable, checking the benchmarks as I go.
- Time permitting, I can then begin generating the databases
- Set up a meeting with Grace to discuss the categories and make sure I can correctly generate suitable databases - as she is more experienced than I am
- Potentially meet with Kevin outside of regular hours next week to ensure I am on the right track with the databases.
