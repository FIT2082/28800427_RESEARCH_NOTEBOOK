Project Workbook â€“ Week 9
=========================

Meeting:
--------
- Grace and I met with Guido and Kevin this Tuesday once again. 
- Kevin assisted me in setting up the CP Profiler tool for windows, which will allow me to analyse the behaviour trees output by the minizinc solver. 
- Kevin also confirmed that the Profiler has been updated to allow us to generate a pixel tree (a simplification of the behaviour tree) which we can use to visualise. 
- The precision of the pixel tree can be tweaked with a simple parameter.
  
Progress:
---------
- Grace is still making some changes to the converter program
- I have devised several lists of potential categories for databases that we could use to test.

To Do:
------
- While Grace is finishing off the converter, I will devise problem categories so that we can group our output databases for analysis
- Once done, I will begin generating the databases and will endeavour to upload them within this repo in batches, as they are ready
