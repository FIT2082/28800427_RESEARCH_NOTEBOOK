Project Workbook â€“ Week 4
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  Meeting on 16/08/18 to establish goals for the project specification
  
Progress:
---------
This week Grace and I finished writing the project specification. I will upload it to this repo. The specification details our research aims and the nature of the project. The part I am most concerned about is the timeline that we devised. While it is achievable in theory, I am aware that in practice we will not be able to find the time to work on the project as much as we would like to.

Tangible achievements:
  - Finalising project specification
  - Clear goals going further into the project

To Do:
------
  - Devise middle-man program
  - Test and attempt to feed into CSP-Singer
  - Review output, tweak input
