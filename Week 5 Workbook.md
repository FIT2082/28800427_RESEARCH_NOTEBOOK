Project Workbook â€“ Week 5
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  I was unable to attend the meeting this week, so once again Grace has filled me in. At this stage it sounds like our progress is minimal, and that we aren't going to have a clear idea of the true timeframe until Grace gets deeper into the SQLite to GenTra converter. 
  
Progress:
---------
  - Grace has decided that she would rather work solo on the converter. In the meantime I am doing some more background research so that I can improve my understanding and hopefully be of some assistance should Grace require it.
  - Ultimately very little progress was made this week due to other assignments that both Grace and I had due. 

To Do:
------
  - Assist Grace's work on convering SQLite to GenTra if necessary. If complete:
  1. Test and attempt to feed into CSP-Singer
  2. Review output, tweak input
