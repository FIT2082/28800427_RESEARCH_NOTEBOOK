Project Workbook â€“ Week 6
=========================

Meeting:
--------
  There was no meeting with our supervisors this week since they were away.
  We did have a scheduled meeting with Julian to check in, however I was also unable to attend this. Grace has caught me up with what she is doing. 
  
Progress:
---------
  Grace has been working on Python code to convert SQLite to GenTra, however we have yet to find a time to work collaboratively.
  At this point our intention is to collaboratively perform the analysis stage.

To Do:
------
  Wait for Grace to finish the conversion code, and assist her with the devlopment if she requires it
  Test the conversion program and figure out any modifications that need to be made
